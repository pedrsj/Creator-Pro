# Flashforge Creator Pro

## Introduction

Creator Pro upgrade project, primarily focused on using Klipper with the stock board, a version of the MightyBoard. Hopefully this project is of some use to others.

I have several printers, a mix of mainstream hobbyist machines and self-built. I use my Creator to print higher temperature materials, predominantly ABS/ASA, single and dual extrusion.

I've undertaken several modifications, to improve its performance, some can be done using the stock firmware:

- TMC22nn (2208 in my case) drivers
- All metal hotends
- Different build plate

In addition, through upgrading the firmware on the stock board to Klipper, I've added:

- Probe (inductive)
- Filament sensors  

## Klipper

I've produced a video that walks you through:

- Building a Mainsail installation
- Generating and flashing the Klipper firmware
- Configuring Klipper using my configuration files in ![Configuration](https://github.com/pedrsj/Creator-Pro/tree/main/klipper/config)
